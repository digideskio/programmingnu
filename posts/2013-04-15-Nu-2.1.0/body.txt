Nu now includes built in operators for generating HTML and
other XML-style markup.  

For usage examples, see the test/test_markup.nu unit tests.

As a simple example, this Nu code:

	(puts (&html (&body (&h1 "Hello!")
	                    (&p "This is a test")
	                    (&p "This is a second paragraph"))))

produces the following output:

	<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><h1>Hello!</h1><p>This is a test</p><p>This is a second paragraph</p></body></html>

You'll note that no line breaks or formatting is included. These can easily be added with xmllint:

	%nush sample-markup.nu | xmllint --format -
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	  <body>
	    <h1>Hello!</h1>
	    <p>This is a test</p>
	    <p>This is a second paragraph</p>
	  </body>
	</html>
	
Also, the Nu source formatter (in beautify.nu) now produces prettier output.
